1. Export as CSV v.1.1 new feature  //
Function to export the current filtered view and have a download button for CSV data, compatible with excel.

The export looks great. Does it export the current filtered view? That would be perfect, then user can export whatever he likes.

2. Control of sortable table (also for click on item for details) v.1.1 new feature
I know Telerik as know for such controls. If license is needed, let me know.

What I found for free: https://reactscript.com/excel-like-react-data-grid-component/


arrows with different coloring.jpg to card Control of sortable table (also for click on item for details)

If columns like ID and Image (available or not) and type and technology can be sorted, it can also work for now. 
The active arrow should be white, the non active little darker 
in sorting. I attach a sample image.https://youtu.be/Q9aYU1Ufkpk?t=674

The sortable table is meant as control. In the future we can use it again on other projects.
 mainly such a control can sort by every column. with arrow up/down its clear how its sorted.

3. Summary of columns in footer V.1.2 new feature //
...it should list the summary the columns and price on the bottom. screenshot attached.

        At the moment it counts always a same value. But it should be related the column. 
        For example if the column is "component type" then in footer it should show the count of current showed component types, 
        for example 4. If the title is "stock warning count" it can count how many components are below the stock threshold. 
        There are some columns with no clear usage. But at the moment there is the count always of all components,
         which is not reflecting anything if its displayed several times again.

        Every column would be great to see something related, if not possible, it can be blank.



        Status: Count of active status
        Count: Summary (just of current in view, important also for CSV export)
        Component pictures: Count of items with a picture:
        Component type: count of different types


        ID: largest ID
        Technologies: Count of technologies


4. Id in Column(new feature) //

Add ID of product, default should be disabled + remember the view setting on user. //

5. Role to view only new feauture

        Rule needed to set user to view only.
        Just to explain role system again, I guess we never did dicuss in detail just to short.
        Normally roles are give with static view. SuperAdmin/Admin/User. MyUsername.Role = Admin
        But in our system a role is just a tag the system can check for it on user. It can be checked by frontend or backend. 
        MyUsername.Roles: Login;Stockmanager;Plumber;StorageAdmin;
        So in the future we need to update this part from a single request to a function of request like 
        DoesThisUserContainRole("Plumber)": bool

6. Field for minimum order quantity

7. Search / Filter for protocol

8. Next to Serial number the count to reduce
Add field for count instead of always take the 1 from QR-Code. Will remember last used count (other task)
